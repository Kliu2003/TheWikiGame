## Team Contract

### Communication
**Team Meetings** 

- We will meet once every 3-4 days, with hopefully two meetings every week. Members should try to make at least one, and we will try to be flexible as a team to arrange dates that are acceptable. Right now, we plan to have one meeting on weekends and one meeting on weekdays. However, we don't have solid plans on which days we would like to meet, as again, we want to be as flexible as possible with each other.

- We will use Discord as the preferred method of meetings, since all group members already have it installed and are comfortable with its interface. We will use a Google Doc to write down as necessary points and issues brought up during the meeting as a way to keep track of important advances and roadblocks during the development process. 

**Assistance** 

- Our group has already made a group Discord server for general chatting and progress updates. We have communicated and ensured that everyone will be active and responsive on Discord. Response should be within 24 hours, which is plenty of time to respond in any environment. We also have each other's phone numbers, that way we can text or call for more urgent matters. 

- If none of our group members can successfully resolve the issue, we will delegate the person with the original issue to request assistance from our TA (Xin Jin). This is because the group member that originally encountered the issue is likely most familiar with the problem at hand.

**Respect** 

- Everyone should treat each other with the utmost respect, and we want everyone to feel as comfortable as possible while while working on the project. We've also worked together in the same group in past projects, so we will all hold each other accountable. Because we've worked together before, we also are more likely to communicate ideas compared to a group that has never interacted before.


### Collaboration

**Work Distribution** 

- We will distribute work in the most equitable manner possible accounting for the differences in separate parts of the project. We will further divide the work accordingly once we have a better grasp on the difficulty involved in implementing the various components of the project. For instance, visualization at this point is a very nebulous concept that requires further research to clarify the specifics of implementation. 


**Time Commitment** 

- Our group prefers a balance between time investment and progression in tasks, so we don't want to set a hard limit on time per week. If you finish your allocated amount of work for the week, the rest is up for each individual to decide whether they want to move ahead or take it easy for the week. However, if you cannot finish, perhaps because the task was more difficult than expected, then we believe around 5 hours of work every week until the final due date is a fair amount. 

- Because of the flexible schedule, there should not be many issues with time commitment. Should they show up, we can work out arrangements where work can be made up the week after. 


**Conflict Resolution** 

- Our team will resolve all conflicts over implementation by analyzing all ideas brought forward and then determining which idea makes the most sense in the interest of the group. 

- If one or more members have not completed their tasks, we will try to work out arrangements that suitably compensate for missed work. For example, if the team member had a particularly busy week on week he may elect to do more work during the next week to make up for lost progress. In general, we will have civil discussions where compromises can be made in order for the smooth and timely progression of the project. 

- If serious conflicts arise, and cannot be resolved (hopefully will not happen), we will talk to our TA, Xin Jin, to mediate the problem.
