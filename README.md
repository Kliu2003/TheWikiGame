# The Wiki Game

Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based editing system. A fantastic way to entertain yourself when youâ€™re bored is to play a game called the Wiki Game (more information can be found at https://www.thewikigame.com/group). The objective of the game is to traverse from one randomly generated Wikipedia page to another in either the shortest amount of time or the shortest number of clicks. However, due to the imperfection of the human mind, it is very unlikely that the user will be able to find the shortest path from one page to another. In our project, we will use graph algorithms and the current Wikipedia dataset to find the series of pages that takes the least amount of clicks and predict the series of pages that take the least amount of time.
